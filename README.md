# Brainstorming Buddy
Brainstorming Buddy is a small streamlit helper tool that I built on GPT-3 to help me generate ideas and identify points to expand on, giving a specific topic.

## How does it work?
Simply enter the topic of interest in the text field below and ideas will be generated. You can also download the output as a txt file.

## How to support the project
You can help support sustaining the project through [buy me coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nainiayoub).
